# Soil Nutrients Detection

This project aims to provide a nutrient recommendation system for soil health monitoring. It uses user inputs such as land cover, soil type, crop type, temperature, and organic matter to suggest the ideal nutrient levels (Nitrogen, Phosphorus, Potassium) for different crops.

## Features

- Predicts nutrient levels based on inputs.
- Generates a bar chart showing the recommended nutrient levels.
- Provides detailed recommendations for specific crops and soil types.
